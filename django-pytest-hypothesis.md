# Django Pytest Hypothesis

Using Pytest & [[hypothesis]] to expand the range of test automation

Parameterised pytest's are nice!

[[hypothesis]] allows us to parameterise a test case using a given strategy,
where a strategy will allow [[hypothesis]] to generate test cases that match that
strategy.

For instance, we can say, provide a parameter which is text, the constraints
we know about are: its text (unicode), min length 2, max length 30 etc. With
that data, [[hypothesis]] can then generate dozens/hundreds of test cases to
exercise your test with all possible variations of the parameter, based on
the constraints you provide to [[hypothesis]]. This makes things like bounds
testing automatic, but also will help exercise edge cases we may not think of
immediately.
