# Multi Paradigm Programming

Making Object Oriented & Functional work together.

Code structure, data structures, state handling etc.

[[Python]] is nice as a mutli-paradigm languge, you can do mostly OO or mostly
functional, or a nice mix of the two.

OO ~= mutable structures, Functional ~= immutable structures.

Using a Sudoku to explore both concepts.

Multi-paradigm is a fairly nice pick and mix of both OO and FP worlds. When
you get it right, you can really benefit from the best of both, but doing it
wrong you can make things a bit of a headache.

Be careful when using a mutable datastructure in an immutable system, make
sure to use the copy-and-modify pattern to avoid accidental mutation


Have a look into the `toolz` library. Also have a look at `pyrsistent.pmap`,
`funcy`, `schema`
