# Pysimplegui

Pysimplegui sits on top of three of the most popular GUI toolkits, and can
also make web UIs via something called REMI.

Presents a significantly simplified API to all of them, hopefully allowing us
to much more simply build functioning UIs for python programs

Looks like its super simple to build UIs with, something to keep in mind in
future! Makes even the QTQuic stuff seem complicated...
