# Full Stack Type Safety

Python sits somewhere in the middle when it comes to type safety. It has the
concept of strong types, but at the same time remains dynamic, which grants
us all sorts of flexibility - itself potentially causing significant
headaches in larger codebases.

One of the other things to keep in mind is whether languages support fixed or
variable attribute data structures.

Within python, [[mypy]] is a pretty decent way of managing type safety when
writing code, but it has no runtime capability.

When working in the full stack, typically we ship data through APIs in JSON,
which is untyped beyond primitive types.

We can help resolve this with things like OpenAPI, with which we can define
schemas for the JSON datastructures.
